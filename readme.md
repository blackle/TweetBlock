== Descripty ==

TweetBlock is a chrome extension to block specific tweets from appearing on your timeline, without blocking the user creating them.

There are a few reasons why this little feature would be useful:

- There is a very popular tweet everyone in your feed is retweeting that you just don't want to see.
- There's an untagged tweet that makes you very uncomfortable.
- Your very good friend is in a odd meme mood and is posting pictures of lewd minions every 30 seconds and you're at work.

Once installed TweetBlock will add a small "X" button on each tweet which will allow you to block it. Blocked tweets appear in a collapsed state that can be expanded with the "toggle visibility" button. Tweets can be unblocked by re-clicking the "X" or visiting the options page, where a list of all blocked tweets can be viewed.

This extension is currently in very-beta release. If you find a bug please report it to the github repo (set as the webpage for this extension.)

Happy blocking!
